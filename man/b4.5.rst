SYNOPSIS
--------
b4 {mbox,am,attest,attverify} [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a helper utility to work with patches made available via a
public-inbox archive like lore.kernel.org. It is written to make it
easier to participate in a patch-based workflows, like those used in
the Linux kernel development.

The name "b4" was chosen for ease of typing and because B-4 was the
precursor to Lore and Data in the Star Trek universe.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------
* *b4 mbox*: Download a thread as an mbox file
* *b4 am*: Create an mbox file that is ready to git-am
* *b4 attest*: Submit cryptographic attestation for patches

OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-d, --debug           Add more debugging info to the output (default: False)
-q, --quiet           Output critical information only (default: False)

SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS
------------------
b4 mbox
~~~~~~~
usage:
  b4 mbox [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [-p USEPROJECT] [-c] [-n WANTNAME] [-m LOCALMBOX] [msgid]

positional arguments:
  msgid                 Message ID to process, or pipe a raw message

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        Output into this directory
  -p USEPROJECT, --use-project USEPROJECT
                        Use a specific project instead of guessing (linux-mm,

CONFIGURATION
-------------
B4 configuration is handled via git-config(1), so you can store it in
either the toplevel $HOME/.gitconfig file, or in a per-repository
.git/config file if your workflow changes per project.

Default configuration, with explanations::

   [b4]
      # Where to look up threads by message id
      midmask = https://lore.kernel.org/r/%s'
      #
      # When recording Link: trailers, use this mask
      linkmask = https://lore.kernel.org/r/%s'
      #
      # When processing thread trailers, use this order. Can use shell-globbing
      # and must end with ,*
      # Common alternative order:
      #trailer-order=link*,fixes*,cc*,reported*,suggested*,original*,co-*,tested*,reviewed*,acked*,signed-off*,*
      trailer-order = fixes*,reported*,suggested*,original*,co-*,signed-off*,tested*,reviewed*,acked*,cc*,link*,*
      #
      # Attestation-checking configuration parameters
      # off: do not bother checking attestation
      # check: print an attaboy when attestation is found
      # softfail: print a warning when no attestation found
      # hardfail: exit with an error when no attestation found
      attestation-policy = check
      #
      # "gpg" (whatever gpg is configured to do) or "tofu" to force TOFU mode
      # If you don't already have a carefully maintained web of trust setup, it is
      # strongly recommended to set this to "tofu"
      attestation-trust-model = gpg
      #
      # How strict should we be when comparing the email address in From to the
      # email addresses in the key's UIDs?
      # strict: must match one of the uids on the key to pass
      # loose: any valid and trusted key will be accepted
      attestation-uid-match = loose
      #
      # When showing attestation check results, do you like "fancy" (color, unicode)
      # or simple checkmarks?
      attestation-checkmarks = fancy
      #
      # How long before we consider attestation to be too old?
      attestation-staleness-days = 30
      #
      # You can point this at a non-default home dir, if you like, or leave out to
      # use the OS default.
      attestation-gnupghome = None
      #
      # If this is not set, we'll use what we find in
      # git-config for gpg.program; and if that's not set,
      # we'll use "gpg" and hope for the best
      gpgbin = None
      #
      # How long to keep downloaded threads in cache (minutes)?
      cache-expire = 10
