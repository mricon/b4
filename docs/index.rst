B4 end-user documentation
=========================
B4 is a tool created to make it easier for project developers and
maintainers to use a distributed development workflow that relies on
patches and distribution lists for code contributions and review.

This documentation is split into two main areas -- one aimed at
maintainers who primarily receive, review, and apply patches to their
trees, and the other at developers who submit patches or patch series
for maintainer review.
