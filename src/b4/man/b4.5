.TH "B4" 5 "2024-06-14" "0.14.0"
.SH NAME
B4 \- Work with code submissions in a public-inbox archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
b4 {mbox,am,shazam,pr,diff,ty,kr,prep,send,trailers} [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is a helper utility to work with patches and pull requests made
available via a public\-inbox archive like lore.kernel.org. It\(aqs
written to make it simpler to participate in patch\-based workflows,
like those used in the Linux kernel development.
.sp
The name \(dqb4\(dq was chosen for ease of typing and because B\-4 was the
precursor to Lore and Data in the Star Trek universe.
.sp
Full documentation is available on \fI\%https://b4.docs.kernel.org/\fP\&.

For full options and what they do, please see \fBb4 \-\-help\fP and \fBb4
subcommand \-\-help\fP\&.
.SS b4 mbox
.sp
This command allows retrieving entire threads from a remote public\-inbox
instance. You can open the resulting mbox file with most mail clients
for actions like replying to conversations or reviewing patch
submissions.
.sp
You can provide the message either as a msgid, as full URL to a
public\-inbox archive, or you can pipe it on stdin.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 mbox \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 mbox [msgid]\fP
Download a thread from the default public\-inbox server and save it in
the current directory as a .mbox file.
.TP
.B \fBb4 mbox \-m ~/Mail [msgid]\fP
Download a thread from your ~/Mail folder and save it in the current
directlry as a .mbox file.
.TP
.B \fBb4 mbox \-fo ~/Mail [public\-inbox\-url]\fP
Download the thread from this public\-inbox server, and add it to your
existing mailbox, filtering out any dupes already in your mailbox
folder.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 am
.sp
This command allows retrieving threads from a public\-inbox instance and
preparing them for applying to a git repository using the \(dqgit am\(dq
command. It will automatically perform the following operations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
pick the latest submitted version of the series (it can check for
newer threads using \fB\-c\fP as well)
.IP \(bu 2
check DKIM signatures and patatt attestation on all patches and code
review messages
.IP \(bu 2
collate all submitted code\-review trailers (Reviewed\-by, Acked\-by,
etc) and put them into the commit message
.IP \(bu 2
add your own Signed\-off\-by trailer (with \fB\-s\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
reroll series from partial updates (e.g. someone submits a v2 of a
single patch instead of rerolling the entire series)
.IP \(bu 2
guess where in the tree history the patches belong, if the exact
commit\-base is not specified (with \fB\-g\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
prepare the tree for a 3\-way merge (with \fB\-3\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
cherry\-pick a subset of patches from a large series (with \fB\-P\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: Unless you intend to do some preparatory work on the series before
applying it to the git repository (e.g. a 3\-way merge), you should
consider using \fBb4 shazam\fP to apply the retrieved series.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 am \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 am \-sl [msgid]\fP
Download a thread from the default public\-inbox server, apply any
follow\-up trailers, add your own Signed\-Off\-By trailer plus a Link:
trailer indicating the origin of the patch, then save the resulting
\&.mbox file in the current directory ready to be applied by \(dqgit am\(dq.
.TP
.B \fBb4 am \-sl \-P 1\-3 [msgid]\fP
Same as the previous example, but pick only patches 1,2,3 from the
entire series.
.TP
.B \fBb4 am \-3 [msgid]\fP
Download the series and prepare the local git tree for a 3\-way merge
by ensuring that all index blobs exist.
.TP
.B \fBb4 am \-\-check [msgid]\fP
Download the series and show if it passes the checks. You can specify
the command using the \fBb4.am\-perpatch\-check\-cmd\fP configuration
option. For the Linux kernel, the default will be the most common
\fBcheckpatch.pl\fP set of options.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 shazam
.sp
This is very similar to \fBb4 am\fP, but will also apply patches
directly to the current git tree using \fBgit am\fP\&. Alternatively, when
used with \fB\-H\fP, it can fetch the patch series into \fBFETCH_HEAD\fP as
if it were a pull request, ready to review and merge. B4 uses the cover
letter as a template for the merge commit.
.sp
If you want to automatically invoke git\-merge, you can use \fB\-M\fP
instead of \fB\-H\fP\&. B4 automatically opens up the editor allowing you to
edit the merge commit message.
.sp
Note: the \fB\-M\fP and \fB\-H\fP options work best for series that have the
\fBbase\-commit\fP info matching an object in your local tree.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 shazam \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 shazam \-sl \-M [msgid]\fP
Download a thread from the default public\-inbox server, apply any
follow\-up trailers, add your own Signed\-Off\-By trailer plus a Link:
trailer with the origin of the patch, then merge this commit
to the current git repository using the cover letter as the merge
commit template.
.TP
.B \fBb4 shazam \-sl \-M \-\-merge\-base v6.4\-rc4 [msgid]\fP
Same as the previous example, but forces the merge\-base to be the
commit\-ish object provided instead of the one listed in the patch
series itself.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 pr
.sp
This command is for working with pull requests submitted using
\fBgit\-request\-pull\fP\&. It provides the following benefits as opposed to using git directly:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
it can check if the pull is already applied before performing a git
fetch
.IP \(bu 2
it checks the signature on the tag or tip commit specified in the pull
request
.IP \(bu 2
it can track applied pull requests and send replies to submitters
using \fBb4 ty\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 pr \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 pr [msgid]\fP
Download the message with the pull\-request and apply it to the current
git tree.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 ty
.sp
If you\(aqve retrieved and applied some patches to your tree, you should be
able to fire up the “auto\-thankanator”, which uses patch\-id and commit
subject tracking to figure out which series from those you have
retrieved you already applied to your tree. The process is usually
pretty fast and fairly accurate.
.sp
To send mails directly using \fB\-S\fP, you should have a configured
\fB[sendemail]\fP section somewhere in your applicable git configuration
files. By default, \fBb4 ty\fP writes out .thanks files in the current
directly that you can edit and sent out using a command like \fBmutt \-f
thanks.file\fP\&.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 ty \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 ty \-a \-S\fP
Locate any retrieved series that you have applied to the current git
repository and send out thanks to all members of the conversation.
.TP
.B \fBb4 ty \-a \-S \-\-dry\-run\fP
Same as above, but instead of actually sending it out show what the
message is going to be, first.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 diff
.sp
The diff subcommand allows comparing two different revisions of the same
patch series using \fBgit range\-diff\fP\&. Note, that in order to perform
the range\-diff comparison, both revisions need to cleanly apply to the
current tree, which may not always be possible to achieve.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 diff \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 diff [msgid\-of\-vN]\fP
Retrieves the thread matching the msgid specified and attempts to
auto\-locate the previous version of the series. If successful, shows
the output of \fBgit range\-diff\fP comparing the patch differences.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 kr
.sp
This subcommand allows maintaining a local keyring of contributor keys.
.sp
Note: this part of b4 is under active development with improvements
planned for the near future.
.sp
For options and their descriptions, see \fBb4 kr \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 kr \-\-show\-keys [msgid]\fP
Retrieve the thread specified and show any cryptographic keys used to
attest the patches.
.UNINDENT
.SS b4 prep, trailers, send
.sp
These commands allow preparing and submitting a patch series for review
on the mailing list. Full documentation is available online at the
following address:
.sp
\fI\%https://b4.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/contributor/overview.html\fP
.sp
For options, see the output of \fBb4 prep \-\-help\fP, \fBb4 trailers
\-\-help\fP and \fBb4 send \-\-help\fP\&.
.sp
\fIExamples\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBb4 prep \-n my\-new\-feature \-f v6.4\-rc4\fP
Start a new branch, forking it from the tag \fBv6.4\-rc4\fP, and prepare
it for adding more patches.
.TP
.B \fBb4 prep \-\-edit\-cover\fP
Edit the cover letter for the current series. This step isn\(aqt
required for most single\-patch submissions.
.TP
.B \fBb4 prep \-\-auto\-to\-cc\fP
Find all addresses that need to receive a copy of the patch series
submission and add them to the cover letter.
.TP
.B \fBb4 prep \-\-check\fP
Run the configured checks on your series to identify any potential
problems. For Linux kernel, this runs \fBcheckpatch.pl\fP with the
recommended set of parameters.
.TP
.B \fBb4 send \-o /tmp/outdir\fP
Generate the patches that b4 is going to send out and save them into
the directory specified. This allows you to review the series before
actually sending them.
.TP
.B \fBb4 send \-\-preview\-to [addr1@example.com addr2@example.com]\fP
Send a \(dqpreview\(dq version of the series for someone to check before
submitting it upstream.
.TP
.B \fBb4 trailers \-u\fP
Retrieve any code\-review trailers provided for your series and apply
them to the current branch.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
B4 configuration is handled via git\-config(1), so you can store it in
either the toplevel \fB$HOME/.gitconfig\fP file, or in a per\-repository
\&.git/config file if your workflow changes per project.
.sp
To see configuration options available, see online documentation at
\fI\%https://b4.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/config.html\fP
.SH PROXYING REQUESTS
.sp
Commands making remote HTTP requests may be configured to use a proxy by
setting the \fBHTTPS_PROXY\fP environment variable, as described in
\fI\%https://docs.python\-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies\fP\&.
.SH SUPPORT
.sp
Please email \fI\%tools@kernel.org\fP with support requests, or browse the list
archive at \fI\%https://lore.kernel.org/tools\fP\&.
